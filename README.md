# Microbial Biodiversity in Human Belly Buttons Dashboard
# Overview:
In this assignment I have built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The biodiversity dataset gathered from http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/ reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

# Process:
## Data Sets 
 * samples.json file.
 
## Dashboard
 * Used D3 library to read the samples.json file 
 * Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
 * Created a bubble chart that displays each sample with varying bubble sizes according to Taxonomic Units.
 * Created a sample metadata displaying each individual's demographic information.
 * Created a gauge chart to display the weekly washing frequency of the individual.
